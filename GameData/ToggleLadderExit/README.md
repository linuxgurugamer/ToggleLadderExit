A simple little mod which allows toggling the new system-wide setting which prevents Kerbals from walking or sliding off the end of ladders.

A toolbar button is provided, as well as a hotkey which does a momentary toggle.  The Toolbar Button shows the current state of the setting

 Keybinding can be changed by editing a file:  ToggleLadderExit/PluginData/keybind.cfg
